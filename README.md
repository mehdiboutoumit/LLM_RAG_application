## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a chatbot for a hospital system that answers ad-hoc questions about patient data, hospital services, and insurance. The chatbot should seamlessly answer both objective questions (e.g., billing amounts) through dynamic queries and subjective ones (e.g., patient feedback) by analyzing reviews. The chatbot will intelligently determine whether to query a database or analyze documents, providing stakeholders with accurate and timely responses without needing to understand SQL or wait for reports.
